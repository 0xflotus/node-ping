DESCRIPTION
node-ping uses UDP_scanning http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_scanner#UDP_scanning (as node is not able to generate iCPM packets)
it may not work correct for hosts that silently drop UDP traffic on their firewall
you need at pcap version 0.1.9 or higher

on the other hand, ping-sys is a simple wrapper for the system ping utility

USAGE
sudo node ping.js [interface] [host]
